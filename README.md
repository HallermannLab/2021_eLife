Eshra A, Schmidt H, Eilers J, Hallermann1 S.
eLife 2021 


The Mathematica code was used to analyze the release kinetics of model 1, 2, and 3. 

The code was run on Mac OSX 11.5.3 with Mathematica 12.1.1. To run the code, the text-files in the "data to fit" folder should be available at "../data to fit/". Reproduce the data in the manuscript, increase noiseRepeats, aNumberDMN05, aNumberDMN2, and aNumberDMN10 as indicated in the comments.
