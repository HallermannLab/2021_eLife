The data from the exported text files (for example "plot InvTau1 C5 fit - quantiles and median.txt", "plot InvTau1 C10 fit - quantiles and median.txt", "plot InvTau1 D fit - quantiles and median.txt", ...etc) were transferred into the provided excel sheets. Each trace of the model predictions of the release rate and delay shown in figure 6E represent an average of the three median values of the fit parameters of exponential fits on 50 repetitions of added representative white noise to the release traces sampled from the simulated trace according to 5-kHz-Cm-measurements (C5), 10-kHz-Cm-measurements (C10), and deconvolution experiments (D). In case of missing or negative values of the fit results, the values at this calcium concentration were omitted from all three groups. Finally, the data were smoothed in IgorPro using a 5-point moving average "Box Smoothing". At low and high calcium concentrations, the variability of the exponential fit results were large in some data (see interquartile range in the Mathematica files, e.g. "Plots"-section) and these unreliable data were not shown.
